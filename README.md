# DocBox: Your Ultimate Hands-On Learning Companion!

DocBox is an innovative tool that takes learning to the next level by seamlessly integrating various projects and tools, much like building blocks in a Lego set. It's important to note that DocBox is not a standalone tool; rather, it leverages the power of other projects and tools to create a comprehensive and immersive learning experience.

## Getting Started

With DocBox, learners can effortlessly access a side-by-side view of a terminal and instructional content, all within a single browser window. This unique feature saves time and eliminates distractions, ensuring a smooth and immersive learning journey. By using DocBox, learners can stay focused on mastering new skills with the training you create.

## Building Blocks

DocBox's architecture is built upon a few fundamental components:

1. **Web Page with Frames**: A web page is used with different frames to render the training content and web based terminal. It can be extended further to provide options to control the lab environment, such as rebooting VMs or getting VM's console access, etc.

2. **Web-Based Terminal Emulator**: DocBox can work with any web-based terminal emulator of your choice. For example, it has a sample implementation with [Shell in a Box](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox) demonstrated here.

3. **Web-Based Content Rendering Tool**: Similarly, DocBox can be used with any web-based content rendering tool, offering flexibility to content developers. For instance, it has a sample implementation with [gitbook-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-serve) demonstrated here.

## Key Features

1. **Integrated Terminal**: DocBox brings you a fully functional terminal integrated directly within the same browser window as your learning material. Say goodbye to tedious alt-tabbing and streamline your learning process.

2. **Side-by-Side View**: Witness the magic of DocBox's collaborative approach as it seamlessly blends interactive demonstrations, code examples, and explanations alongside your terminal, providing an immersive hands-on learning environment.

3. **Flexible Implementation**: DocBox's implementation is flexible with your choice of terminal emulator or content rendering option. This empowers content developers to continuously improve the learner experience.

4. **Extensible**: DocBox can harmoniously combine different projects and tools. Content developers may customize the learning environment to match their unique needs and preferences.

## Advantages

- **Self-Hosting**: DocBox is to be hosted within the lab itself, eliminating the need to invest in a highly available server for this offering.

- **Functionality Expansion**: DocBox can be extended further to include other functionalities, such as management of the lab environment.

- **Tool Flexibility**: The flexibility to choose the terminal emulator or content rendering tools of your choice makes DocBox adaptable to various learning scenarios.
